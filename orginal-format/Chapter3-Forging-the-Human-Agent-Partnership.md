Chapter 3 
Forging the Human-Agent Partnership




The Dawn of the Agentic Era
We are entering a new phase of work driven by sophisticated AI agents. This marks a significant evolution in how organizations operate and where professionals provide value. The emerging model is the Human-Agent Partnership (HAP)—a practical realignment of responsibilities where human expertise guides powerful AI execution. As with any major technological shift, this will require some roles to evolve while creating new opportunities.
This chapter provides a framework for structuring work when AI agents can handle many tasks faster, at a lower cost, and with greater consistency than previously possible. The integration of agents into your organization isn't a matter of "if," but "how." The key is to manage this transition with a clear strategy rather than reacting to it as it unfolds.
In this new era, our understanding of productivity is expanding. The model positions humans as strategic directors, creative leads, and ethical reviewers. They guide AI systems through well-crafted instructions, iterative feedback, and critical judgment. This partnership leverages two different types of intelligence: human insight for direction and AI for execution.
To better understand this shift, let's compare traditional workflows with the new agentic model:
Aspect
	Pre-AI Agentic Era
	The AI Agentic Era
	Primary Role of Human
	Content creator and executor
	Strategic director and quality arbiter
	Workflow Steps
	The employee does everything.
	Employee focuses on what they want, agent focuses on doing it, employee reviews quality. 
	Time Allocation
	Majority on content creation and formatting
	Majority on prompt crafting, quality evaluation, and strategic direction
	Skills Valued
	Domain expertise, writing, design execution
	Domain expertise, prompt engineering, critical evaluation, agent orchestration
	Iteration Process
	Manual revisions based on feedback
	Prompt refinement and human judgment on AI outputs
	Quality Control
	Self-review or peer review
	Human evaluation of AI outputs, and vice versa 
	Creative Input
	Direct human creativity throughout
	Human judgment selecting and refining AI-generated options
	Technical Knowledge
	Software-specific skills (PowerPoint, Word)
	Understanding AI capabilities, limitations, and effective deployment
	Collaboration
	Linear handoffs between team members
	Parallel human-AI experimentation with rapid iteration
	Resource Bottlenecks
	Human time and expertise
	Quality of prompts, human judgment, and strategic direction
	Emotional/Cognitive Shift
	Repetitive tasks, high cognitive load from manual work
	Judgment-intensive work, managing multiple agents, adapting to rapid capability evolution
	Let's put this simply. The best work will come from pairing your brain with an AI's processing power. You provide the creative ideas, the strategic direction, and the common-sense judgment. The AI agent provides the raw speed and does the heavy lifting to execute your vision.
The reality of this new setup is that your core skills need to shift. Your value is no longer in the doing of the work, but in the directing and refining of it. This means you need to get exceptionally good at two things:
1. Prompting: Clearly telling the agent what to create.
2. Reviewing: Critically evaluating the agent's output and telling it what to fix.
The unavoidable truth is that when one person can direct an agent to do the work that once took a team, you won't need the whole team for that task anymore. The future of work is built on these human-agent partnerships, but they will be much leaner than today's teams.
Case Study: How Seven AI Agents Saved Me 
Stephen Dulaney, a member of the Agentic Service Group at MERGE, a marketing agency, describes his experience working with agents. 
“Every morning at 7:43 AM, I'd open what I called "The Spreadsheet of Doom." Thirty-seven rows of active projects. Release dates. Blockers. Dependencies. Priority rankings that shifted based on whoever had emailed me most recently.
I'd scan each row, mentally calculating what needed attention. The authentication system throwing errors in Project 12. The client demo for Project 23. The technical debt in Project 7 nobody wanted to discuss. By the time I reached row 37, I'd forgotten what I'd decided about row 3.
Thirty-two minutes later, I'd finally pick something to work on—usually whatever felt most urgent, not most important. The whole time, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something critical buried in those other 36 projects.
Here's what nobody tells you about working at the intersection of AI and user experience: every project spawns three more questions. That conversational AI interface reveals a gap in your authentication system. The evaluation framework exposes inconsistencies in your data pipeline. The mobile optimization uncovers assumptions about user workflows that need complete rethinking.
So your 15 projects become 23, then 31, then 37. You're not building the future anymore—you're playing mental Jenga, trying to keep everything from falling over.
The worst part wasn't the time spent on triage. It was the decision fatigue. Every morning, the same impossible question: "Out of these 37 things, what actually matters most today?" I'd make that decision with incomplete information because who has time to deeply analyze 37 projects every single morning?
I tried priority frameworks. Impact-effort matrices. Kanban boards. Nothing worked because the fundamental problem wasn't organizational—it was cognitive. My brain couldn't hold the context of 37 concurrent projects and make good decisions about resource allocation.”
“It was terrible.”
Stephen goes on, “My first attempt was predictably naive. I built a single AI assistant that could read project documentation and answer questions like "what should I prioritize today?"
The assistant gave generic advice. "Focus on the project with the nearest deadline." "Work on the highest-impact item." All technically correct, all completely useless. The problem was expertise. A good project portfolio manager doesn't just apply generic prioritization rules. They understand technical debt patterns. They recognize scope creep masquerading as feature requests. They can smell a project heading toward a cliff three weeks before anyone else notices.
My single assistant was like asking a new intern to make strategic decisions about a complex portfolio. It had all the same information I did, but none of the specialized knowledge to interpret it correctly.”
The Revelation
Steven goes on to say, “I was walking past a conference room where our UX team was doing project reviews. Sarah was deep in a usability analysis, Marcus was questioning the technical feasibility of a proposed feature, and Lisa was connecting patterns she'd seen across three different client engagements.
Each person brought specialized expertise. Sarah didn't try to evaluate technical architecture. Marcus didn't attempt UX analysis. They trusted each other's domains and collaborated where their expertise intersected.
That's when it hit me: Why was I trying to build one AI that did everything poorly instead of multiple AIs that each did one thing exceptionally well?”
Building the Seven-Agent Team
For Steven’s project, he designed seven specialized agents, each with a specific role:
Scanner monitors project health, crawling through documentation and commit histories to calculate health scores based on code quality, test coverage, and technical debt indicators.
Arbiter handles daily prioritization using five factors: business impact, technical urgency, resource availability, dependency chains, and strategic alignment.
Nexus maps dependencies and identifies blockers. It understands that delaying the authentication system affects seven other projects, while the mobile optimization is relatively isolated.
Skeptica monitors assumption aging. It tracks when project assumptions were last validated and flags ones that might need revisiting. "You assumed this API would be stable six months ago—worth checking?"
Witness identifies cross-project patterns. It notices when three different projects are solving similar problems in different ways and suggests opportunities for consolidation.
Synthesis detects reusability opportunities. When it sees the same authentication pattern being built in four different projects, it flags the chance to create a shared component.
Compass calculates strategic alignment, evaluating how well each project advances our broader objectives and identifying initiatives drifting off course.
Conductor orchestrates all the other agents, determining which agents need to run when, managing information flow between them, and synthesizing their individual insights into coherent recommendations.
What Surprised Me
“The first surprise was how much personality mattered. Skeptica needed to be naturally suspicious and questioning. Arbiter had to be decisive and confident. Witness required patience and pattern recognition. When I tried to make them all sound the same, their recommendations became generic and indistinguishable.
The second surprise was the emergence of something like office politics. Arbiter would recommend focusing on high-impact projects. Skeptica would argue for addressing technical debt. Compass would push for strategic initiatives. I had to build conflict resolution into the system—ways for agents to negotiate when their recommendations conflicted.
“They became thinking partners, not just tools that executed my decisions” 
The most unexpected discovery was that the agents taught me things about my own decision-making. Watching Witness identify patterns across projects revealed blind spots in how I was thinking about the portfolio. Skeptica's assumption tracking showed me how often I was working from outdated information. They became thinking partners, not just tools that executed my decisions.”
The Transformation
Stephen describes how this impacted him: “My morning routine changed dramatically. Instead of 32 minutes of cognitive overload, I now spend 5 minutes reviewing the agents' overnight analysis. Scanner gives me a health dashboard. Arbiter presents three prioritized focus areas with reasoning. Nexus highlights any critical blockers that emerged.
The quality of decisions improved even more than the speed. Instead of reactive prioritization based on whoever emailed most recently, I'm working from a systematic analysis of all 37 projects. I catch problems earlier. I invest in the right technical debt reduction. I spot opportunities for consolidation before they become expensive to implement.
But the biggest change is psychological. I no longer feel like I'm constantly dropping balls. The agents are monitoring everything I can't hold in my head.”
What This Actually Means
“Building this system taught me that effective multi-agent systems mirror effective human teams. Specialists outperform generalists when properly coordinated. Clear roles prevent conflicts. Good communication protocols enable collaboration.
The future of AI isn't better individual agents—it's better orchestration of specialized agents. We're moving from "AI that can do anything" to "AI teams that can solve complex, multi-faceted problems."
Legal teams could have agents specialized in research, analysis, brief writing, and case strategy. Medical teams could coordinate diagnostic agents, treatment planning agents, and patient communication agents. Software teams could orchestrate agents for architecture, testing, documentation, and deployment.
“complexity doesn't require more powerful individual agents. It requires better coordination between specialized agents”
The key insight is that complexity doesn't require more powerful individual agents. It requires better coordination between specialized agents.
Every morning at 7:43 AM now, instead of opening the Spreadsheet of Doom, I'm having a productive strategic conversation with seven AI colleagues who never sleep, never get overwhelmed, and never forget to check on Project 37.”

A Dynamic Partnership, Not a Simple Hierarchy 
It's easy to picture this new world as a simple, one-way street: humans direct, and AI agents do the work. But the reality of the Human-Agent Partnership (HAP) is more sophisticated and flexible than that. This isn't a rigid chain of command; it's a dynamic workflow where roles are assigned based on capability.
In many cases, a human expert will orchestrate a team of AI agents to execute a complex project. But the roles can, and will, reverse. We are already seeing AI agents that act as project managers or orchestrators. These agents can analyze a project, break it down into its component tasks, and then delegate that work.
Crucially, they delegate to the best resource for the job. A task like mass data analysis might be assigned to another specialized AI. But a task requiring deep creative insight, complex ethical judgment, or a persuasive human touch would be assigned to a person. In this scenario, the human is the "doer," but they are acting as a high-value specialist, executing a critical task that the AI system itself cannot.
Even with this flexibility, the overall trend is clear. The vast majority of what we now consider routine operational work—the grunt work—will be handled by agents. The work delegated to humans, whether they are in a strategic or specialist role, will be of a higher and more focused nature. This creates an incredibly efficient system, but one that ultimately requires fewer human hours for the same level of output.
The Evolving Human Role: From Execution to Judgment
As agents become integrated into workflows, professional roles will transform fundamentally. The shift is from tactical execution to strategic oversight, from doing the work to directing the work. Tomorrow's high-value contributors will not be those who can execute tasks brilliantly, but those who can effectively orchestrate both human and agent teams.
The Value Hierarchy:
Routine Execution: The work agents already do better than humans. This tier has no human future.
Specialized Execution: Handling the edge cases and exceptions that agents can't process, performing work that requires physical presence or legal accountability. This tier shrinks continuously as agents improve.
Agent Orchestration: Designing workflows, managing agent fleets, handling exceptions, and optimizing human-AI collaboration. This is the new middle class of knowledge work—valuable but requiring continuous skill evolution as agent capabilities improve.
Strategic Judgment: Setting direction when there's no algorithmic answer, making bets with incomplete information, navigating trade-offs between competing values. This is the highest-value human work and the most protected from automation.
Humans Create, Modify and Delete Agents
Deploying an AI agent isn't a "set it and forget it" event. Success in this new era requires you to transition from a simple user to an active manager, architect, and part-time therapist for your digital workforce.
1. The Use/Improvement Time Split: From Builder to Director
In the early days of a new agent's existance, you are essentially its overworked mentor. It will need constant guidance, context, and correction. This is a temporary, yet necessary, workload. Plan to spend a disproportionate amount of time on improvement and training—perhaps a 70/30 split where 70% of your time is spent coaching the agent (refining prompts, correcting errors) and only 30% is spent getting useful output. The agent is clumsy and makes basic errors. Over weeks or months, however, this ratio flips dramatically to a 95/5 split, where you spend 95% of your time leveraging its flawless output, and only 5% on occasional maintenance. At that stage, the agent is less a colleague and more a high-performance appliance.
2. Refactoring Agents: The Digital Office Reorganization
Like human teams, agents often suffer from scope creep or redundancy. To maintain peak efficiency, you must periodically act as the organizational consultant, performing two key refactoring moves:
* Split: When a single agent becomes a jack-of-all-trades, its performance drops. You break it into smaller, more focused agents. For example, the "Omni-Drafting Agent" that was hired to write emails, press releases, and internal memos gets everything wrong, often mixing the tone. The solution is to Split it into the "Corporate Memo Bot" (dry, legalistic tone) and the "Marketing Hype Engine" (all caps, excessive adjectives) for better, more focused results.
* Merge: You find two or more agents (or packaged tools) doing essentially the same job, often due to parallel development. You must combine their capabilities into one superior agent. For instance, if the "HR Screening Bot" and the new "Applicant Tracking System Agent" are both grading resumes based on keywords, you Merge them into a single, unified "Candidate Vetting Agent," fire one of the licenses, and stop paying twice for the same digital headache.
3. Extending Agents: The Knowledge Infusion
This involves providing an agent with new capabilities or knowledge relevant to your organization’s unique needs. This is how you inject company wisdom to elevate an off-the-shelf model into a proprietary asset. This often means providing the agent with your golden documents—the perfect, high-quality examples of output, process documents, or proprietary data that define success at your firm. For example, you take a general-purpose coding agent and feed it a library of your firm's cleanest, most secure, and highly-reviewed code submissions, teaching it how to code your way.
Agent Compositional Patterns: The Art of Digital Orchestration
The true power of AI agents emerges when they are composed together into larger, intelligent workflows. These patterns are less about the individual agent and more about how you, the human architect, design the system's architecture.
The Orchestrator Pattern
The most fundamental compositional pattern involves a single orchestrator agent that manages the entire workflow. This agent receives the high-level goal, breaks it down into sequential or parallel steps, assigns those steps to lower-level specialized agents, and then synthesizes the final output. The Orchestrator acts as the central brain and project manager for the entire operation. This allows you to scale complexity, as the human only interacts with the Orchestrator, which handles all the internal chaos and coordination.
Low-Level Agent Roles: The Specialized Digital Workforce
Within these compositional structures, the actual work is executed by agents with incredibly narrow, high-fidelity skill sets. These are the digital workers on the floor, each performing a specialized function better and faster than any single human. Consider the following agent examples and how they might be combined together to create a more sophisticated solution. 
* The Researcher Agent: This agent's sole purpose is to retrieve information. It is expertly trained in navigating databases, using external search tools, and quickly identifying relevant data from vast, unstructured sources. It is incapable of judgment or synthesis, only retrieval.
* The Data Synthesizer Agent: This agent takes the raw, unstructured data blob provided by the Researcher and processes it. It cleans the data, identifies key trends, and formats the output into a structured, usable format (like a JSON file or a clean spreadsheet). It transforms data from "messy information" to "actionable insight."
* The Critic Agent: This is perhaps the most important specialized agent for quality control. Operating under the Swarm or Orchestrator pattern, the Critic's job is to read the output of its peers and attempt to poke holes in the logic. It is programmed for pessimism and skepticism, identifying gaps, errors, or flaws in the synthesized results, forcing the workflow to iterate and self-correct without human intervention.
* The Final Editor Agent: This agent specializes purely in polish and presentation. It takes the final, validated content—which is structurally sound but perhaps stylistically bland—and formats it for a specific audience. It handles the Tone and Persona Override, ensuring grammar is perfect, all links are active, and the output is converted into the required final medium (a polished presentation, a PDF report, or an email).
Of course, the agents that you create will be specific to your needs, or those of your team. 


Building and Managing AI Agents 
Creating effective AI agents for yourself and your department doesn't require technical expertise, but it does benefit from thoughtful planning and ongoing management. Think of building agents like training new, highly specialized team members—each one needs clear instructions, a specific role, and regular feedback to improve over time. Your job is to be the architect and the manager.
Agent Design Principles
The foundation of any successful agent starts with clear, focused design. Before you create an agent, you should be able to describe what it does in a single sentence. If you find yourself saying "it helps with various things" or "it handles different tasks," you're probably trying to build an agent that's too broad. An agent that reviews expense reports and flags items needing manager approval has a clear purpose. An agent that "helps with finance stuff" will end up confused and confusing.
Keep each agent focused on doing one thing exceptionally well rather than many things poorly. This is like the difference between kitchen appliances—a toaster makes excellent toast because that's all it does, but you wouldn't want it to also brew coffee. You'll get better results creating separate agents for customer onboarding emails and customer support responses rather than one giant "customer communication" agent that tries to handle everything.
Your instructions to agents need to be specific and complete, much like the directions you'd give a new employee on their first day. Include not just what to do, but how to do it and what to avoid. Instead of telling an agent to "handle time off requests," give it clear steps: check if the employee has available days, verify their manager's name, and send a confirmation email with dates formatted as MM/DD/YYYY. The more specific you are upfront, the fewer problems you'll encounter later.
Agent Refactoring Practices
Even well-designed agents need regular updates to stay effective. The agent that worked perfectly six months ago might now feel clunky or get confused by new situations that have emerged. Refactoring is simply the practice of improving and updating your existing agents, like renovating a room in your house rather than tearing down and rebuilding.
Set a calendar reminder to review your agents every quarter. During this review, ask yourself whether each agent is still doing what you need and whether there's now a faster or better way to accomplish its task. Pay particular attention to repetitive problems. If you keep manually fixing the same issue or people repeatedly ask "why did the agent do that?", it's a clear signal that the agent needs updating. For example, if your meeting scheduler keeps booking people during lunch hours and you're constantly moving those meetings, update the agent's instructions to automatically exclude the 12-1pm time slot.
As you gain experience with an agent, look for opportunities to simplify. You might discover that your agent asks three clarifying questions but really only needs one to do its job. Streamline it. Similarly, when you discover a better way to phrase something or identify a new scenario that comes up frequently, Extend its knowledge by adding that directly to the agent's instructions.
Agent Composition Practices
Complex work often requires multiple specialized agents working together rather than one massive agent trying to handle everything. This is agent composition—building systems where different agents handle different parts of a process and pass work between them, like instruments in a symphony playing their individual parts to create something greater.
When you face a complex task with multiple distinct steps, create separate agents for each step. For a hiring process, you might create one agent that screens resumes, another that schedules interviews, and a third that sends follow-up communications. Each agent becomes excellent at its specific role, and together they manage the entire workflow.
You can also create simple, reusable agents that serve as building blocks for other agents. A "check calendar availability" agent might be used by your meeting scheduler, your interview coordinator, and your event planning agent. This way, you build the calendar-checking logic once and reuse it everywhere, rather than rebuilding it into each agent that needs it.
When one agent finishes its work and passes to another, make the transition clear and explicit. Decide what information gets passed along and in what format. Your invoice processing agent might complete its work and hand off to your payment scheduling agent, passing along the invoice number, amount, vendor name, and due date in a consistent format that the second agent expects. Each agent should also maintain some independence—if the invoice processing agent breaks, your payment scheduling agent should still function for payments that come through other channels.
Agent Inventory and Duplication Analysis
As you and your team create more agents, keeping track of them becomes essential. Without a good inventory system, you'll inevitably create duplicates, waste time maintaining similar agents, and leave people confused about which agent to use.
Start with a simple spreadsheet or document that lists every agent, its purpose in one sentence, who created it, which department uses it, and when it was last updated. Before creating any new agent, search this inventory first. Something similar might already exist, and you could improve that existing agent rather than starting from scratch.
Periodically review your inventory to identify duplicates and consolidate. If you discover agents named "Email Drafter," "Email Writer," and "Email Composer" that all essentially do the same thing, Merge them into one well-maintained agent. When you replace an old agent with a new one, mark it clearly as deprecated with a note directing people to use the new agent.
Every six months, conduct a more thorough audit. Which agents haven't been used in months? Which should be retired completely? This regular housekeeping prevents your agent collection from becoming cluttered and unmanageable.
Agent Usage Analysis and Reputation
Understanding which agents people actually use and how well they perform helps you invest your time wisely. You want to improve agents that people rely on and fix or retire agents that aren't working, much like reading product reviews before making a purchase.
Track basic usage information for each agent: how many times it's used each month, how many different people use it, and what they use it for most often. More importantly, collect feedback systematically. After someone uses an agent, ask one straightforward question: "Did this agent help you?" with a simple yes/no option.
Agents earn good reputations by consistently doing their jobs well. Share success stories with your team. Announce that the invoice agent processed two hundred invoices last month with only two needing manual review. Help people identify reliable agents by marking them in your inventory—perhaps with labels like "team favorite" for high usage and satisfaction, or "experimental" for newer agents still being refined.
When an agent shows low usage or receives negative feedback, investigate quickly. Either fix it, improve it based on the feedback, or retire it if it's no longer needed. Don't let broken or ineffective agents linger, as they damage trust not just in that one agent but in your entire agent ecosystem.
Moving Forward
Start with one well-designed agent for your most common task, using clear and specific instructions. Keep a simple inventory and note what works and what doesn't. Each month, choose one agent to improve based on what you've learned. As your needs grow, build new agents thoughtfully using proven approaches rather than starting from scratch each time. Most importantly, let actual usage and feedback guide where you invest your time and effort. The goal isn't to accumulate the most agents—it's to create tools that genuinely make your work easier and more efficient.
Cultivating an Adaptive Organizational Culture
Technology is only half the equation. Successful transition to Human-Agent Partnering depends on fostering an adaptive organizational culture that acknowledges both opportunity and disruption:
Promote Lifelong Learning as Survival: This isn't aspirational—it's mandatory. Continuous skill development is the only path to remaining relevant. Organizations must create innovation labs, host internal hackathons, and implement reward systems that celebrate successful human-agent collaborations. But they must also acknowledge that not everyone can adapt at the required pace.
Build Psychological Safety for Experimentation: Employees must feel empowered to experiment with agents, ask questions, and even fail without penalty. But this safety must be balanced with accountability—those who refuse to engage or persistently fail to adapt will face consequences.
Champion Early Adopters: Celebrate employees who master agent orchestration, making them visible role models. But be honest that you're celebrating the future while acknowledging that the past is ending.
Communicate with Radical Transparency: Tell employees the truth about what's being automated, what skills will be valuable, and what the realistic career paths look like. Sugarcoating helps no one and destroys trust when reality arrives.
The Uncomfortable Truths We Must Confront
This chapter has attempted to balance optimism about human-agent collaboration with honesty about its implications. Let's be explicit about what we've implied:
Truth 1: Not Everyone Will Successfully Transition Some employees lack the cognitive flexibility, learning capacity, or judgment skills to move from execution to orchestration. No amount of training will change this. Organizations must support these individuals through generous severance and transition assistance, but cannot guarantee them roles in the AI-augmented future.
Truth 2: The Math Doesn't Balance If agents can do the work of five people, you don't need five people doing "higher-value" work. The organizational pyramid becomes dramatically more pointed, with far fewer positions at every level.
Truth 3: Entry-Level Positions Disappear Junior roles where people learned by doing routine work are evaporating. This breaks the traditional career ladder and makes it unclear how future senior professionals will develop.
Truth 4: The Transition is Isolating Working primarily with AI agents rather than human colleagues is psychologically isolating. The casual human connection that made work bearable diminishes. Organizations must actively create opportunities for human collaboration and community.
Truth 5: Your Best People May Leave High performers with options may exit rather than navigate the uncertainty of transformation. Organizations must identify and retain critical talent while managing the transition, even if it means paying premiums that temporarily eliminate efficiency gains.
Conclusion
The rise of AI agents is not a threat to human value—it's a transformation of what human value means. By embracing Human-Agent Partnerships, we are not automating ourselves out of relevance. We're automating the mundane to focus on the meaningful, at least for those who successfully make the transition.
This new collaborative paradigm empowers us to offload cognitive burdens, amplify our creative and strategic capabilities, and focus on the uniquely human skills that will always be indispensable: judgment under ambiguity, ethical reasoning, creative vision, and relationship building.
But we must be honest: this empowerment is not universal. The AI-powered enterprise is ultimately a human-empowered one, but it empowers far fewer humans than the pre-AI enterprise employed. It creates opportunities for unprecedented levels of creativity, productivity, and professional fulfillment—but only for those who can adapt, who possess the right capabilities, and for whom positions still exist.
The choice facing every professional is stark: develop the skills to orchestrate agents and exercise judgment, or accept that your current role has no future. The choice facing every organization is equally clear: invest aggressively in transition support and honest communication, or face the talent flight and moral reckoning that comes from pretending this transformation is painless.
The future of work is not human versus machine. It's humans and machines, working together, accomplishing what neither could alone. But it's far fewer humans than we have today, doing fundamentally different work than they did before.
That's the promise and the challenge of the agentic era. Embrace it with eyes open, or be left behind by those who do.
