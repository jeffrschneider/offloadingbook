# Chapter 7: Building the Offloading Rocketship

## Core Concepts

**The Agentic Services Group** establishes enterprise infrastructure for agent deployment. As described, this entity functions as "a delivery and support team, not a speculative research group," prioritizing speed and security over experimental research.

The organizational philosophy emphasizes **centralized enablement with decentralized execution**—the central team manages foundational tools and guardrails while business units handle domain expertise and deployment.

## Key Architectural Components

**AI-Assisted Coding** represents a fundamental shift where applications utilize agents as "specialized, smart function[s] within [their] stack" rather than simple conversational interfaces. This enables autonomous execution of multi-step workflows.

Essential services include:
- Standardized agent frameworks with security protections
- Centralized knowledge foundations for RAG systems
- Standardized work artifact generation with compliance templates
- Unified observability and auditing across all agent interactions

## Organizational Insights

**Analyzing Business Operations** through communication data transforms unstructured information into strategic insights. The system identifies decision patterns, expertise networks, and operational bottlenecks through communication flow analysis and dynamic expertise mapping.

## Critical Governance Elements

The **AI Steering Committee** provides cross-functional oversight, establishing policies, prioritizing initiatives, and managing risk. The committee includes executive sponsors, business unit leaders, security officers, and legal representation.

**Communication Infrastructure** requires dedicated intranet sites, active support channels ("Ask the Agent Experts"), office hours, and regular newsletters highlighting successful deployments.

## Team Structure

The transformation requires specialized roles beyond traditional job titles:

### Leadership Functions
- **Program Bulldog**: Strategic planning and business alignment
- **Chief Agentic Visionary**: Technical architecture
- **Entrepreneur**: Revenue identification
- **Voice of the Customer**: User experience
- **OCM Instigator**: Change management
- **Anxious CTO**: Enterprise risk conscience

### Delivery Roles
- **Agentic Engineers**: Builder/coder
- **Platform Engineers**: Infrastructure
- **Delivery Managers**: Operational rhythm
- **AI Training Development Specialists**
- **Product Owners/Analysts**

## Success Factors

Organizations must **overstaff early** to prevent the Agentic Services Group from becoming a bottleneck. The team structure prioritizes enablement capacity over cost control, ensuring the central function accelerates rather than constrains organizational velocity.

The transformation requires "Maximum Transparency, Minimum Comfort" in communications and deliberate positioning separate from traditional IT departments to maintain innovation velocity.
