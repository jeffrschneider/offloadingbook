# Chapter 4: Creating Your First Agents

## Core Concepts

**Agent Definition**: The document distinguishes agents from simple LLMs by stating: "a simple LLM is a powerful talker, while an Agent is a strategic doer." Agents perform complex decision-making, reasoning, planning, and real-world actions through tool integration.

## Agent Progression Levels

1. **Null Agent**: Basic prompt-response with no external tools or memory
2. **Grounded Context**: Agents connected to verified organizational knowledge bases
3. **Action and Reason**: Agents equipped with callable corporate functions and APIs
4. **Agentic Loop**: Self-correcting iterative process following Goal → Plan → Execute → Observe → Refine cycle

## Enterprise Readiness Requirements

Shareable agents require:
- **Minimum Viability**: Clear name, description, and assigned owner
- **Governance**: Maintenance cycles, role-based access control, centralized kill switch
- **Observability**: Usage monitoring, efficacy tracking, cost management
- **Compliance**: Security reviews, performance baselining, official registration

## Build Hierarchy

- **Tier 1**: Individual personal agents (low-code solutions)
- **Tier 2**: Departmental agents for shared processes
- **Tier 3**: Agentic Services Group handles infrastructure and high-risk initiatives

## Strategic Sourcing

The framework recommends building for proprietary competitive advantage, buying commodity solutions, and customizing vendor products for integrated enterprise deployment.

## Innovation Model

The text introduces "ephemeral software"—temporary solutions built quickly to solve immediate problems, reflecting how "the economics have changed" when creation costs drop dramatically.
